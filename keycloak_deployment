To deploy keycloak, you can either deploy it independently as a stateful set or use the helm chart I will provide below
If you want to deploy independently, you have to deploy postrgres alongside it.
it uses postgres as a database to store users, realms etc.
you can locate the image via https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/keycloak
To deploy using helm, use the helm repo specified below
 https://codecentric.github.io/helm-charts
use $helm repo add keycloak  https://codecentric.github.io/helm-charts
to add the repo to your local helm repository
you can view the available charts using
$helm search repo keycloak
use keycloak/keycloak
To view the values file run the command below
$helm show values keycloak/keycloak
You can edit the values file to what you want it to look like 
thus you have to save the values content to a new file using the command below
$helm show values keycloak keycloak/keycloak >> keycloak.values
I have uploaded a values file where I have already configured the environmental vatriables you will need to deploy keycloak using this helm chart
If the helm values file is broken, add this following lines to the env variables section
change "" to |
KEYCLOAK_USER
admin
KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD
admin
Use whatever username and password you want.
also note that this helm deployment automatically comes with postgres configured and installed as a stateful set 
to install the helm chart with the values file already created use the command below
$helm install keycloak keycloak/keycloak --values keycloak.values
After the installation, you will have to expose the keycloak-http service
Thus change it from a cluster ip to a NodePort 
use $kubectl edit svc keycloak-http
to edit the svc. 
note that it uses vi as the editor
thus, use 's' to edit the file
use 'esc' then ':wq' to save and quit
Then you can sign in using admin, admin as username and password respectively as configured in the environment variables
 When creating an ingress for keycloak, make sure to add the path /auth 
add this as a constant because it was declared in the helm values file
